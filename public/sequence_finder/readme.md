## DNA Sequence Finder

DNA Sequence Finder is a project that takes a DNA sequence as input and will then find the occurrences of a smaller sequence within it. An output table is created that gives some useful stats on the query, such as the number of matches divided by the length of the main sequence. Checking the optional "Visual Output" box will also show the main sequence and highlight ever occurrence of the smaller sequence that is found within it.
