## The Wall

The Wall is a project that allows users to anonymously submit a message of <5000 characters. The 10 most recent messages are then displayed chronologically on the main page. The oldest message is deleted once a new one is submitted. A word filter is implemented to censor language submitted by users. On the back end, a postgreSQL database is used to store posts that the server interacts with using the node-postgres package.
